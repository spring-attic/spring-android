  Previous Android versions are no longer officially supported.

1.0.0.M3 (2011.05.10)

New Features
* Support for Spring Social 1.0.0.M3 through the new Spring Android Auth 
  library, which includes a SQLite datastore, and Android compatible Spring 
  Security Encryptors. Spring Social is currently supported in Android 
  version 2.3.1 (API Level 9) and higher.
* Updated RestTemplate to be compatible with Spring Framework 3.1.0.M1.
* Separated core functionality into a new Spring Android Core library.
* Restored support for CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory.

Known Issues:
  There are several known issues when working with Spring Social in an Android
  environment. The majority of these are specific to older Android releases.

* https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SOCIAL-138 - String.getBytes(Charset 
  charset) is not available in Android versions prior to API level 9
* https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SOCIAL-139 - The HttpComponents version 
  verification is failing on 1.x Android versions
* https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SOCIAL-144 - TwitterTemplate 
  TimelineTemplate.updateStatus() is throwing an exception in Android API level 
  8 and lower.
* https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SOCIAL-148 - LinkedInTemplate not 
  working on Android because of javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement 
  dependency
* https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SOCIAL-149 - All OAuth2 template tests 
  are failing on Android 1.x


1.0.0.M2 (2011.02.07)

New Features
* Updated RestTemplate to include HttpComponents HttpClient 4.x support using 
  the HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.
* New RestTemplate instances now use the HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory 
  by default.
* Added support for Object to XML serialization through the 
  SimpleXmlHttpMessageConverter, which utilizes the Simple XML serializer.
* Added support for RSS and Atom feeds through the SyndFeedHttpMessageConverter, 
  RssChannelHttpMessageConverter, and AtomFeedHttpMessageConverter.

Deprecated:
* Deprecated CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory and supporting classes, since the 
  Commons HttpClient 3.x is not native to the Android platform. These classes 
  will be removed in the next release.

Removed:
* Commons-Logging has been removed due to conflicts with private Android 
  classes. This future of this library will be reevaluated for the next 
  release.

1.0.0.M1 (2010.11.18)

New Features
* Commons-Logging facade for Android allows libraries using commons-logging to 
  log to Android's native log. The logging levels specified for Commons Logging 
  can be almost directly mapped to the levels that exist in the Google Android 
  platform. The following list shows the mapping implemented by this logger:

  - JCL TRACE to Android VERBOSE
  - JCL DEBUG to Android DEBUG
  - JCL INFO to Android INFO
  - JCL WARN to Android WARN
  - JCL ERROR to Android ERROR
  - JCL FATAL to Android ERROR	  

* RestTemplate support in Android. You can now utilize RestTemplate calls in 
  Android projects using the CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory. Due to known 
  issues with Android's java.net.HttpURLConnection implementation, we 
  recommend avoiding using SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory at this time.

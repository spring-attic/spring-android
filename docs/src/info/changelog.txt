Spring Android 1.0.0 Milestone 1
================================

New Features
	* Commons-Logging facade for Android allows libraries using commons-logging
	  to log to Android's native log. The logging levels specified for Commons 
	  Logging can be almost directly mapped to the levels that exist in the 
	  Google Android platform. The following list shows the mapping 
	  implemented by this logger.
	  
		* JCL TRACE to Android VERBOSE
		* JCL DEBUG to Android DEBUG
		* JCL INFO to Android INFO
		* JCL WARN to Android WARN
		* JCL ERROR to Android ERROR
		* JCL FATAL to Android ERROR	  

	* RestTemplate support in Android. You can now utilize RestTemplate calls in
	  Android projects using the CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory.  Due to 
	  known issues with Android's java.net.HttpURLConnection implementation, we
	  recommend avoiding using SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory at this time.
